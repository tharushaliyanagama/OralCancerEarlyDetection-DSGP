# ðŸ§  Oral Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build an intelligent, multimodal AI-based web application that assists in the early detection of oral cancer using image and text data. The system not only identifies cancerous conditions but also provides explainable results to support healthcare professionals and increase user trust in AI-driven diagnostics.

## Problem Statement
Oral cancer is a major health issue in many developing countries like Sri Lanka, with many cases going undiagnosed in early stages. A lack of awareness, limited access to specialists, and stigmas related to oral health contribute to delayed detection, especially among industrial employees and female workers commuting late at night.

## Objectives
- Detect cancerous signs in oral cavity images using CNNs.
- Analyze textual data (like symptoms, habits, history) using machine learning models.
- Combine both modalities to make a final prediction.
- Use Explainable AI (SHAP & LIME) to interpret the modelâ€™s decision.
- Build a simple Flask web app for users to interact with the model.
